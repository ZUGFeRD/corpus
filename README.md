Collection of real, sample and test ZUGFeRD invoices, partly with artificial errors

## Purpose
These are basically test files for two categories of software: ZUGFeRD **readers** should understand the correct files and ZUGFeRD **validators** should (not report errors in the correct files and) additionally flag the errors in the incorrect files.
